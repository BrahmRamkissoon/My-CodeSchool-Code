Your `import` ensures clarity of `scope` within a `module`.
By using a `parameter`, you protect the `global` data that might have been `overwritten`.
All imported data becomes `locally` scoped to the `anonymous function`, to be used in `closure`.
Thus, when compared with `searching` the entire `scope chain`, `imports` are both clearer and faster.
