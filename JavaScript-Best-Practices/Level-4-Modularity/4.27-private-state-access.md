In simple `augmentation`, the `module` file and the augmentation file `do not` share their `private state`. Augemented module `properties` may only `access` the `private` date from their file's `closure`. `Private` date from the `original` closure `will not` be lost, and `will` be accessible to all original `properties` that referenced it.
