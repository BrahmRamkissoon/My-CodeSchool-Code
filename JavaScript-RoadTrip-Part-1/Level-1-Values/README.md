## 1.11 Concatenating a Mystery String
_Task:_
Use the + operator to concatenate the following words and numbers. All values need to be separated by a space:

- "eight"
- 5
- "six"
- "two"
- 3
- 7
The resulting string output should be: `"eight 5 six two 3 7"`

_Solution:_
```
"eight " + 5 + " six " + "two " + 3 + " " + 7 
```
## 1.12 Accessing a String's Length
