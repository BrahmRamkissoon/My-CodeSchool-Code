Let's add some result filtering options to our page. We want to be able to click on a filter and highlight the corresponding tours with a .highlight class. Go ahead and get started by creating the click handler for the .on-sale filter from the #filters list. Don't worry about the contents of the click handler function, we'll get it working in the next few challenges.
